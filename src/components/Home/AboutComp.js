        <h3 text-color="white">In RevealEvent, we are planning 'an event ticket booking system' where the organizer can register an event with the help of artists. Users can book the ticket for that event and select the seats as per convenience. In this project, we intend to develop end-to-end application which means we lead the entire software development lifecycle from conceptualization and requirement gathering to deployment & maintenance. In this system, we will be using well-structured data for database management using MySQL for ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval & data integrity. In this web application, we will be using front-end technologies for the best look & feel such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap & ReactJS. In this web application, we plan to use technologies like Spring-Boot and .Net Framework for creating Restful API for the server side to fetch data and feed it into the database.</h3>
